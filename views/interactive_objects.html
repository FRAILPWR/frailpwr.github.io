                <p>Exploding barrel is a variation of conventional, metal barrel, which stores flammable liquid of type A. Thanks to
                its properties, exploding barrel can (and should) be used as a weapon - note that it's perfectly suited for
                traps. Explosive barrels come in variations with different radiuses: 2, 4 or 8 meters. When exploded, barrels inflict
                fire damage ranging from 5 to 15 points of life.</p>
