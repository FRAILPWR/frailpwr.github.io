                <h2 id="arena_a">Arena_a</h2>
                <p>This map is designed for Boss Fight game mode in which actor controlled by user fights against stronger enemy
                known commonly as boss. Level project is similar to widely known Summoner's Rift map from League of Legends.
                Available surface contains varied areas - from quite open spaces to narrow passages between walls in the
                "jungle". It is possible to jump on almost all of the obstacles - it may be useful to take advantage of
                attacking from above or moving across the map not only at ground level.</p>
                <p>Many different game objects are present in this level. Thanks to that arena_a is simply large research area for
                tests of effective environment usage in combat. Actors can utilize game objects to their advantage, but they also
                have to remain alert because this gameplay aspect is double-edged sword and it can be used against them.</p>

                <p>Arena_b is typical duel arena for Boss Fight game mode. It is a large open space which can be useful in distance
                fight researches. At ground level there are almost none of environment game objects to make sure contest between
                actors is just about pure combat skills.</p>
                <p>Additional aspect of gameplay are upper overpasses. It is possible to get there by using narrow staircase at one
                of the pillars. This optional part of the map can give actor height advantage or power up his statistics (thanks to
                some game objects), but be cautious - many situated traps will not make this task easy. Side hall (behind the huge
                bar gate) may also be used as smaller duel arena of different scheme.</p>

                <p>Arena_c is also Boss Fight arena, but it has some additional contents. This map presents huge castle tower
                surrounded by ruins which make some kind of labyrinth. High density of obstructions makes good opportunity for
                obstacle avoiding researches. At the bottom of the tower there is hidden area which contains... Some secret. Ground
                level of the map is patrolled by regular enemy actors who are weaker than boss himself, but are present in greater
                number.</p>
                <p>Script of this map simulates task and its successive stages. To accomplish final goal user has to make sequence of
                actions (acquire key, get in teleport). Then he is transported at the top of the tower where proper Boss Fight takes
                place. Final arena is small round area without any other objects - only two fearless warriors who battle for glory...
                And for science!</p>

                <p>2nomansland map is designed for Capture The Flag game mode in which two teams fight for enemy flag. Many small
                obstacles in different arrangements are placed on level surface. Middle of the map is its point of inversion, thanks
                to which both squads compete on equal terms.</p>
                <p>Such map scheme provides many opportunities for researches. Close placement of obstacles may test if actors can
                avoid and maneuver between them. Large open areas allow using various game strategies for example flanking the enemy
                from the side. Obstacles can also be used by actors as partial or full covers.</p>

                <p>This map is modeled after original dust2 map contained in Counter-Strike game series. In this case it is used for
                asymmetric CTF contest between two teams. Level scheme consists of small open areas connected by different passages.
                Not many obstacles are placed on the surface available for actors.</p>
                <p>Many possible routes between both bases provide wide variety of gameplay strategies. Such level design tests if
                actors can work as a team and promotes quality over quantity of their actions. Relatively complicated path scheme may
                be useful for pathfinding researches.</p>
